## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the bike share business operation in New York City in order to create a compelling proposal on the possibility of adapting a bike share business in Des Moines. Using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, a Tableau story was created to help investors determine whether they should invest in a bike-sharing program. For this analysis, data from Citi Bike in August 2019 was used as a starting point to determine important information such as number of rides, demographic and ride patterns that could be expected in the city of Des Moines.

## Summary
In conclusion, a total of 2,344,244 Citi Bike rides were recorded for August 2019 in New York City. A large proportion of the customers are annual subscribers and predominantly male. The ride patterns of the users are mostly during the weekdays around 8am, 5pm and 6pm, suggesting that riders are using Citi Bike to commute to their workplace. This implication is supported by low number of bike rides after 8am and before 5pm, which corresponds to work schedule of many workers in New York City which is 9am to 5pm. However, it is important to note that the data applies specifically to New York City cannot be necessarily extrapolated for the city of Des Moines as two cities are different from each other. Therefore, for future analysis, it is suggested to analyze cities that are more similar to the city of Des Moines in terms of population, demographic and city landscape. By doing so, a more accurate estimation can be generated which further helps the investors determine the profitability of adapting a bike sharing business in Des Moines. Another suggestion is to analyze the weather in Des Moines to figure out if the weather conditions of the city can support the bike sharing business. Lastly, it is also important to analyze the likelihood of the population of Des Moines to use bike sharing services. For instance, traffic in the city can be analyzed to determine if there is a higher incentive for people in the city to use a bike sharing service to commute to work.
